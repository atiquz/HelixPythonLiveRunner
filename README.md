## ⚙️ Setup Guide

Follow these simple steps to get started with **HelixPythonLiveRunner** 👇  

1. **Create your workspace:**
   - Make a folder named `Python Learning` in this location:  
     ```
     C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\Desktop\Python Learning
     ```
   - Inside it, create a file named `main.py`.  
     Example content:
     ```python
     print("Hello, Helix!")
     ```

2. **Create the batch file:**
   - In this location, create a new file named:
     ```
     C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\Desktop\pythonLearning.bat
     ```
   - Copy the batch script from this repository into that file.

3. **Verify paths in the script:**
   - Make sure the two paths match your setup:
     ```
     C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\Desktop\Python Learning
     C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\Desktop\pythonLearning.bat
     ```

4. **Run the script:**
   - Double-click `pythonLearning.bat`.  
   - It will automatically:
     - Open **Helix** in the left pane with `main.py`.
     - Run **Python output** live in the right pane — auto-refreshes whenever you save the file.
